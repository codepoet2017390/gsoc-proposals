**Mifos Initiative:  Android Field Operations App Version 4**

**László Karsai**

**Project idea: Android Field Operations App Version 4**

I part my workflow into three parts according to the evaluations. My work would include high quality User Experience based on the Android Style.

1. **Before the first evaluation**

May 30 - June 11: Creating a feature to track the attendance. I think it is challenging but I think I can handle it by creating a time shared preference which stores all the dates when the application gets started.

June 12 - June 19: Creating a monitoring collection sheet where bulk amount of savings and loans can be shown. I think it in this case there is no blocker as I would add all the available savings and loans into one list by using an adapter.

June 19 - June 26: Implementing feature to store the previously entered search queries to help the user make the searching process faster and the workflow easier. I think it is challenging but I think it would a usable solution if I create a shared preference containing the previously entered input data and list those which start the same way as the input. It would get refreshed after typing each letter.

Here is a mockup what I think of:

June 27 - June 30: Period of closing this section (final tests and starting documentation) and submitting Phase 1 evaluation.

**Deliverables: tracking the attendance, collection sheet and feature to remember all the previously entered queries.**

2. **Before the second evaluation**

June 30 - July 9: Enabling views for task list and reports. I think there is no blockers in this case because in this case, I only need to implement some activities where the task list and reports can be viewed.

July 10 - July 17: Integrating notifications into the smart phone regarding to the application. It could be connected to the path tracker and alerts if your are in a new position and asks you if you want to give a comment to that place in your app. It is sounds very challenging for me. It is a good way to make the application smarter so I would make more work on focusing what else could be built-in into the notification system.

July 18 - July 24: Integrating SMS communications. It sounds very challenging for me and I think it would be optional if the user could create groups, centers or clients, and maybe operations with savings or loans. I have to create a plan how to test it.

July 25 - July 28: Period of closing this section (final tests and continuing documentation) and submitting Phase 2 evaluation.

**Deliverables: views for task list and reports, integrating notifiactions and SMS communication**

3. **Before the final evaluation**

July 28 - Aug. 6:** **Extending offline support for other areas of the application where it is not done, yet e.g.: for centers. I would make a request to clarify it better.

Aug. 7 - Aug. 13: Improving the user interface for capture of surveys. I think it is very challenging I would have to make these surveys clever enough so that the user could express their opinion fully. Then we should have them processed in a productive way.

Aug. 14 - Aug. 20: Improving data scoping and role-based permissioning. I think it does not have blockers and I would create a data scoping in which there is a period e.g: 2 months and if a certain user input is older than this, it would be neglected(deleted). I would check all the inputs dates when the application starts. In connection with the role-based permissioning, I think it would be worth clarifying what a single user should be able to do. When it is clear, the role-based permissioning can be done according to a certain attribute of the user(s).

Aug. 21 - Aug. 29: Period of closing the final section (finishing documentation) and submitting the final evaluation.

**Deliverables: Extending offline support, improving UI, data scoping and role-based permissioning **

**Why I am the right person for this project**

I used to say that there are no problems, only opportunities for better solutions. I think I am hardworking enough to keep giving my best and reach my goals. Besides it, I have gained relevant coding experiences for 5-6 years in different languages, mostly Android and Java. Additionally, I like the challenges and being challenged because I can learn/work fast and efficiently and am willing to do so in order to fulfill the expectations against me.Last but not least, the UI of the applications, which I develop, are very important for me because a good UI would make me more productive as I can see that I have done so far fit in the application well.

**Career goals**

First of finishing the university with the most gained experiences which are available for me. After that I would like to go abroad to have international living and working experience. I have not pointed out a country where I would like to live so far. I would like to be a senior software developer. I think it is one of the best position because you have responsibility and opportunity to help others by sharing your knowledge with them.

**Source code I have written**

I started to write an application for Android smart phones to pay attention better on my expenses. The name of it is Expense Observer. Here is the link for my GitHub repository created for this project: [https://github.com/karsai1993/expense_observer](https://github.com/karsai1993/expense_observer).

**Gitter chatroom**

Yes, I have visited Gitter chatroom for android-client (and self-service-app). My Gitter ID is karsai1993 as written among contact information, too.

**Contribution to open source projects**

The open source projects I have contributed to:

* openMF/self-service-app ([https://github.com/openMF/self-service-app](https://github.com/openMF/self-service-app))

As soon as I could run the application on my phone, I could realizes some issues, reported them. I have already solved all of them. I tried to explain the problems in each cases to make it understandable via text and/or screenshots. When I made a solution, I created screenshots to prove that the problem is gone. Pull request is created.

* openMF/android-client ([https://github.com/openMF/android-client](https://github.com/openMF/android-client))

I have recognized issues and solved them on the same way as written above. My pull request was approved and merged. From that time, I reported some further issues.

* k9mail/k-9 ([https://github.com/k9mail/k-9](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9))

	I have reported some issues.

**Experiences**

I have gained experience with:

* Android - home made projects and open source organization

* Java - working experience, home made projects, homeworks

* bash - working experience

* python - working experience

* Javascript - final project in BSc

* C/C++ - Arduino, home made projects, homeworks

* MySQL - working experience, homeworks

**Commitments in the summer**

 I have a part-time job in IT company being in the aviation industry. I think it does not sound well from your point of view but please, note the followings:

* my working time is flexible, so I can work when I want

* As I can work fast and efficiently, in the last two weeks, I had enough time to get deeply into the MifosXDroid and Self Service App applications, reporting issues, solving problems besides my job, so this would not be a problem in the summer, either.

* I can work in this project at least 5 hours a day in the week and 8 hours a day in the weekend which is 41 hours.

Please note, that the Summer of Code would be my first priority in this summer because I think it is a significant opportunity to learn and get better.

**Platform and reference User Interface**

Yes, I have cloned the original one, I have not created a fork from either of them so far.

**Submitting patches and source code to Mifos X**

Yes, I have submitted several ones. Here is the list:

**Taking part in Google Summer of Code**

Unfortunately, no, I have not participated in it so far.

**Applying to multiple organization**

Yes, I plan to apply to multiple ones. As of Mifos Initiative, I would like to apply to Self-Service - Android App Version 2.0 project, too. So in this organization, there are two projects which grabbed my attention.

Mifos Initiative is definitely my first choice. I am happy to have found it among a lot of organizations.
