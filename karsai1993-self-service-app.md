**Mifos Initiative:  Self-Service - Android App Version 2.0**

**László Karsai**

**Project idea: Self-Service - Android App Version 2.0**

I part my workflow into three parts according to the evaluations. My work would include high quality User Experience based on the Android Style.

1. **Before the first evaluation**

May 30 - June 4: Creating register/sign in related activities and resources (User Sign Up part one).

June 5 - June 11: Creating an admin user who has all the rights to update, change the customer login user and to deactivate if needed. In addition, the Administrator should be able to assign certain permissions to the customer login user so as to control the actions she/he can perform. Testing the available actions/views of administrator user and customer login user (User Sign Up part two).

June 12 - June 18: After signing in, the customer login user should fill a form which ask her/him about his basic information e.g.: email address. She/he would be able to decide to choose a profile picture and change her/his password (User Details Feature and Update User Details).

June 19 - June 26: Creating validation process between the user and the organization through the user’s personal data.

June 27 - June 30: Period of closing this section (final tests and starting documentation) and submitting Phase 1 evaluation.

**Deliverables: Register/sign in process, admin user and customer login user information processing, validation process**

2. **Before the second evaluation**

June 30 - July 5: Creating user’s input process and queries (to display only the certain customer login user related data) regarding to retrieving list of her/his savings accounts details, transactions and charges to the savings accounts.

July 6 - July 12: Creating user’s input process and queries (to display only the certain customer login user related data) regarding to list of her/his loan account details, transactions, repayment schedule and charges of each loan account.

July 13 - July 19: Creating update and withdraw process of loan application

July 19 - July 25: Implementing third party account transfers

July 25 - July 28: Period of closing this section (final tests and continuing documentation) and submitting Phase 2 evaluation.

**Deliverables: User input handling (savings and loan related details, transactions and charges), update and withdraw possibilities of loans, third party account transfers**

3. **Before the final evaluation**

July 28 - Aug. 6: Creating user wizard which would help the user(s) who freshly signs in the application to get a brief explanation about the functions of application and how she/he(they) can use it. This wizard is planned to be available if the user(s) would like to have a look at it again.

Aug. 7 - Aug. 13: Mobile wallet integration

Aug. 14 - Aug. 20: Unit and integration test of the whole application focusing on my deliverables

Aug. 21 - Aug. 29: Period of closing the final section (finishing documentation) and submitting the final evaluation.

**Deliverables: User wizard, mobile wallet integration, unit and integration tests**

**Why I am the right person for this project**

I used to say that there are no problems, only opportunities for better solutions. I think I am hardworking enough to keep giving my best and reach my goals. Besides it, I have gained relevant coding experiences for 5-6 years in different languages, mostly Android and Java. Additionally, I like the challenges and being challenged because I can learn/work fast and efficiently and am willing to do so in order to fulfill the expectations against me. Last but not least, the UI of the applications, which I develop, are very important for me because a good UI would make me more productive as I can see that I have done so far fit in the application well.

**Career goals**

First of finishing the university with the most gained experiences which are available for me. After that I would like to go abroad to have international living and working experience. I have not pointed out a country where I would like to live so far. I would like to be a senior software developer. I think it is one of the best position because you have responsibility and opportunity to help others by sharing your knowledge with them.

**Source code I have written**

I started to write an application for Android smart phones to pay attention better on my expenses. The name of it is Expense Observer. Here is the link for my GitHub repository created for this project: [https://github.com/karsai1993/expense_observer](https://github.com/karsai1993/expense_observer).

**Gitter chatroom**

Yes, I have visited Gitter chat room for self-service-app (and android-client). My Gitter ID is karsai1993 as written among contact information, too.

**Contribution to open source projects**

The open source projects I have contributed to:

* openMF/self-service-app ([https://github.com/openMF/self-service-app](https://github.com/openMF/self-service-app))

As soon as I could run the application on my phone, I could realizes some issues, reported them. I have already solved all of them. I tried to explain the problems in each cases to make it understandable via text and/or screenshots. When I made a solution, I created screenshots to prove that the problem is gone. Pull request is created.

* openMF/android-client ([https://github.com/openMF/android-client](https://github.com/openMF/android-client))

I have recognized issues and solved them on the same way as written above. My pull request was approved and merged. From that time, I reported some further issues.

* k9mail/k-9 ([https://github.com/k9mail/k-9](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9))

	I have reported some issues.

**Experiences**

I have gained experience with:

* Android - home made projects and open source organization

* Java - working experience, home made projects, homeworks

* bash - working experience

* python - working experience

* Javascript - final project in BSc

* C/C++ - Arduino, home made projects, homeworks

* MySQL - working experience, homeworks

**Commitments in the summer**

 I have a part-time job in IT company being in the aviation industry. I think it does not sound well from your point of view but please, note the followings:

* my working time is flexible, so I can work when I want

* As I can work fast and efficiently, in the last week, I had enough time to get deeply into the MifosXDroid and Self Service App applications, reporting issues, solving problems besides my job, so this would not be a problem in the summer, either.

* I can work in this project at least 5 hours a day in the week and 8 hours a day in the weekend which is 41 hours.

Please note, that the Summer of Code would be my first priority in this summer because I think it is a significant opportunity to learn and get better.

**Platform and reference User Interface**

Yes, I have cloned the original one, I have not created a fork from either of them so far.

**Taking part in Google Summer of Code**

Unfortunately, no, I have not participated in it so far.

**Applying to multiple organization**

Yes, I plan to apply to multiple ones. As of Mifos Initiative, I would like to apply to the Android Field Operations App Version 4 project, too. So in this organization, there are two projects which grabbed my attention.

Mifos Initiative is definitely my first choice. I am happy to have found it among a lot of organizations.
